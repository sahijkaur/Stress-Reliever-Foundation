		<h1>Why do we get stressed ? </h1>
		<h2>We look at why we get stressed and how we can deal with it.</h2><br><br>
		<p>Everyone feels stressed at times. But there are times in our lives when we feel particularly overwhelmed with tension. And during them we can feel really awful and have highly unpleasant stress symptoms to deal with.<br><br>

			This summer has seen a period of unprecedented political upheaval – during and after the EU referendum. The result has cast many people into deep gloom and others have found themselves very stressed about the result and what it might mean for them personally and for the country and the continent of Europe.<br><br>

			At the same time, the news worldwide is causing many individuals a great deal of stress too. We live in very uncertain and dangerous times and so it is entirely understandable that many adults are feeling extremely anxious.<br><br>

			This kind of stress can be alleviated – just as stress generated from work or personal circumstances can. But most therapists would agree that talking out how you feel with friends and family, whom you know share your views, can be very cathartic and helpful. On the other hand, if some of your friends or, even worse, many of your family members see things somewhat differently from you, you might well want to avoid discussing the current situation with them – at least for now.<br><br>

			Basically, I think that everyone who feels uncertain, unhappy and stressed because of the political events of the summer of 2016 has every justification for feeling that way. And they should tell themselves that what they are going through is normal for them given the strange circumstances of the current period.<br><br>

			Having said that, there are plenty of ways in which you can deal with stress and tension and the symptoms they produce, and these three articles should help you to do that.

			Let's look first at what happens to our minds and bodies when we are stressed.</p><br><br>
			<h1>The stress response</h1><br><br>
			<p>We are all born with an instinctive stress response.<br><br>

			Whenever a potentially dangerous situation arises, stress hormones are released into our bloodstream.
			They cause instant mental and physical change in us, giving added strength and endurance, and make us feel pumped-up and ready to fight.
			Stress hormones also enable us to run away much faster than we could normally manage.
			This response is generally called the 'fight or flight syndrome'.<br><br>

			The fight or flight syndrome was vital when we used to live in the wild and were liable to attack from other tribes or wild animals. We still use it today.<br><br>

			Suppose someone tried to snatch your child while you were shopping.<br><br>

			Your mouth would go dry, your hands sweaty, your heart would pound and you'd feel terror-stricken. But you'd probably also find yourself filled with strength and determination, and think nothing of screaming and thumping the assailant until he let go.<br><br>

			Your automatic response would be to fight, and, with luck, it would save the day.<br><br>

			So, if this stress response is so terrific, what's the problem?</p><br><br>
		    <h1>Women and stress</h1>
					<p>
			A US study by Professor Shelley Taylor found that women cope with stress better than men because of their female hormones.<br><br>


			Professor Taylor believes that in history women often didn't have the option to fight or flee because they were frequently pregnant or encumbered by small children.<br><br>


			Instead, women developed a more suitable strategy, which was to 'tend and befriend'. So a woman would look after children and do what she could to keep them safe, but she would also enlist help from a female friend.<br><br>


			The key to this behaviour was, and is, a female hormone called oxytocin. Professor Taylor's team believe it is this difference that accounts for women seeking out other women to talk to when the going gets tough.<br><br>


			Whether or not you go along with all of this, far more women than men discuss their stresses with a friend.<br><br>


			However, there are an awful lot of women who are incapacitated by severe stress and who are suffering exactly the same sort of stress-related symptoms that we see in men</p><br><br>
