  <h1> Introvert or Extrovert? Everything You Need to Know About Them</h1> 
		<h2>So what’s the difference between an extrovert and an introvert?</h2><br>
  <p>Before I get into any definitions, the most important thing you need to know is introversion and extroversion are only a spectrum, and most of us fall along this continuum, which means no one is strictly one way or the other. Famous Swiss psychiatrist Carl G. Jung once said,</p> <br>

	<h1> 1. Extroverts: the ones who talk the most</h1><br>
	<ul>
		<li>People and social situations excite and energize them.</li>
		<li>They usually initiate and engage in conversations.</li>
		<li>They can talk about anything with anyone.</li>
		<li>They don’t mind others paying full attention to them.</li>
		<li>Meeting new people doesn’t faze them.</li>
	</ul><br>
	<h1>2. Introverts: the ones who prefer thinking over speaking</h1><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Alone time is the way to recharge.</li>
		<li>They use their eyes and ears more than their mouths.</li>
		<li>They don’t like small talks.</li>
		<li>hey prefer standing away from the spotlight.</li>
		<li>It is quite uncomfortable to meet new friends.</li>
	
	</ul><br>
	<h1>3. Ambiverts: the ones who are a mix of extroverted and introverted tendencies</h1><br>
	<ul>
			<li>They often wonder whether they need alone time or external stimulation.</li>
			<li>They could be quiet during the entire conversation, but also share what they are passionate about.</li>
			<li>Sometimes, they find small talks insincere.</li>
			<li>If in the right context, they don’t mind attention, but often they prefer standing at the sidelines.</li>	<li>They are fine with talking to new people, but it’s better to do it with their friends.</li>

	</ul><br>
	<h1>Do Extroverts Manage Stress Better?****************
	 Congratulations!!!!!!!!wallflowers</h1><br>
	  <p >Because this cannot always have been true.</p><br>
		<p>Our society favors extroverts as the outgoing individuals who discover continents and sell stuff. Introverts are seen as relatively confined in their own inner world, making them potentially vulnerable to internally generated fears and anxieties.

		Whether extroverts really are better at handling stress than introverts depends on two interrelated questions. First, are there genuine differences in how introverts and extroverts handle stress? If so, is the extrovert method more effective? One obvious place to start is with the social approach to handling anxiety.</p><br>
	
	<h1>Sharing Troubles</h1><br>

<p>Extroverts are more social and more communicative. This means that they air their grievances rather than letting them fester.

People who let off steam in this way probably suffer less from intense anger and hostility that predicts anxiety-related illnesses including hypertension and heart disease. Admittedly, airing of grievances has a downside because it can aggravate conflicts. Yet, extroverts have better social networks and enjoy better social support from local communities, electronic networks, religious communities, and other organizations that are widely believed to protect health against the ravages of psychological stress.

Introverts and extroverts experience the world – and experience anxiety – in markedly different ways.</p><br>

<h1>Anxiety</h1><br>
<p>
Extroverts are said to be stimulus hungry. It is as though their brains are not receiving enough stimulation to keep them alert. That is why they are outgoing and why they are motivated to seek stimulation by cultivating interesting activities and seeking out companionship. So an extroverted student might choose to study in a restaurant surrounded by other people and the din of human activities.

Introverts, on the other hand, behave as though they were over-stimulated. They prefer to study in quiet places where they can devote their undivided attention to the task at hand.

If extroverts are chronically under stimulated and therefore vulnerable to boredom, introverts are over stimulated and more vulnerable to anxiety.

Being more a prey to anxiety has many adverse consequences for health. To begin with, introverts are more prone to suicidal ideation (1) and may therefore be more likely to take their own lives – an action that can be interpreted as retreat from overwhelming over stimulation.</p><br>

	<h1>Depression and Heart Disease</h1><br>
<p>
Because they are more vulnerable to anxiety, introverts are at greater risk of clinical depression. At least one study with a small sample found that members of the clinically depressed population are more likely to be introverts (1).

Depression is biochemically linked to heart disease. Both show the same markers of inflammation (C-reactive proteins, 2). Introverts have less robust immune systems that could account for connections between introversion and both depression and heart disease (3). If introverts are more likely to bottle up hostility than extroverts, this would also make them more vulnerable to heart disease. </p><br>

<h1>	The Good News</h1><br>
<p>Introverts are less prone to hide negative emotions—and less stressed because of it. One study examined 404 Israeli participants and their patterns of faking and hiding their emotions. This study examined the effects of hiding negative emotions and faking positive ones, noting the effects on both relationship satisfaction and physical health, and found that introverts were less likely to hide negative emotions in their relationships and less likely to suffer as a result. 

Extroverts were both more likely to hide negative emotions in their relationships, and more likely to experience lower relationship satisfaction and negative effects on their health, and this effect was more pronounced than the consequences for faking positive emotions. 

In fact, faking positive emotions did not bring the same negative consequences at all, demonstrating that the “fake it until you make it” approach to happiness in relationships may be a better approach than holding in frustrations rather than talking them out. This in itself is important to know, but it’s also nice for introverts to know that their natural tendency to talk things out brings health benefits and a more satisfying relationship in the long run.  

There are many other benefits to introversion, so in focusing on your strengths instead of your weaknesses, and balancing things out with the right stress management techniques, introverts can be quiet, resilient, and very happy.</p><br><br><br>
